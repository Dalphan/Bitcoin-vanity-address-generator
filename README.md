## Description
A Bitcoin vanity address generator is a tool that creates Bitcoin addresses with specific patterns or prefixes chosen by the user.
These addresses are generated by repeatedly creating random private keys and deriving their corresponding Bitcoin addresses until one matches the desired pattern.
Vanity addresses are often used for personalization or branding purposes, making the address more recognizable or memorable.

This project aims to create a vanity address with a chosen prefix and the corresponding public key.  
Example with prefix `Danie` : `1DanieHYi7Q8ujpbYPsQKa7SbbScLirBFz`

## How it works
### 1. Generate a random private key
Generates a random private key using the secp256k1 elliptic curve algorithm, with the package `coincurve`.

### 2. Derive the compressed public key from the private key
Obtain the compressed public key generated with the private key using the `coincurve` package.

### 3. Derive the Bitcoin address from the public key
1. Perform SHA-256 hashing on the public key
2. Perform RIPEMD-160 hashing on the SHA-256 hash
3. Add the version byte to the RIPEMD-160 hash (0x00 for mainnet)
4. Perform SHA-256 hashing on the versioned RIPEMD-160 hash
5. Perform SHA-256 hashing on the previous SHA-256 hash
6. Take the first 4 bytes of the double SHA-256 hash as the checksum
7. Append the checksum to the versioned RIPEMD-160 hash (step 3)
8. Encode the result in Base58 to obtain the Bitcoin address

### 4. Check if the address starts with the desired prefix
Check if the address generated in step 3 starts with the desired prefix. 
- If it does, it returns the address, the corresponding public key, the total time taken and the totanl number of addresses generated. 
- If it does not, repeat steps 1-3 with a new random private key.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python vanity_address.py -p <prefix> [-v <version>] [-t <threads>]
```

- `-p <prefix>`: The desired prefix for the vanity Bitcoin address.
- `-v <version>`: The generator file to use:
    - `1`: for `address_generation.py`, the slowest version;
    - `2`: for `faster_address_generation_.py`, faster version;
    - `3`: for `fastest_address_generation.py`, the fastest version that requires the C file `address:gen.c`, that needs to be compiled, see the `Setup` section.
- `-t <threads>`: The number of threads to use for generating addresses. The default is the maximun available.

## Setup
In order to use the fastest version of the address generator, you need to compile the C file `address_gen.c` using the following command:
```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
